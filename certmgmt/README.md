## ÔøΩ Issuer Mapping (based on [Issuers](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/issuers/))

| Lab | Primary issuer type | Notes |
|-----|----------------------|-------|
| cert-generation-basics.md | CA | Manual root CA is created via self-signed cert, then used to sign leaf certs (equivalent to cert-manager CA issuer behavior). |
| cert-generation-semiautomated.md | ACME | Uses certbot with Let‚Äôs Encrypt (DNS-01). |
| cert-generation-automatedwithcertmanager.md | ACME | Uses cert-manager with Let‚Äôs Encrypt (HTTP-01) via ClusterIssuer. |
| cert-generation-automatedwithcm-e2etls.md | CA | Uses SelfSigned to bootstrap a root, then CA ClusterIssuer for internal mTLS; also defines an ACME ClusterIssuer for public ingress. |
| cert-basics.md | N/A | Conceptual fundamentals (no issuer). |

Notes
- ‚ÄúVault‚Äù issuer is not covered by current labs.
- Where both ACME and CA are present, the table lists the primary issuer focus for the exercise.

## üìã Quick Start Guide

### **Option 1: Complete Learning Path (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Read the main guide first
cat cert-management-basics-to-advanced.md

# 2. Follow exercises in order
# Start with: cert-basics.md
